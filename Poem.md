# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds like dreams abide.
Drifting softly, white and bright,
Painting shadows in the light.

Whispers of the wind they share,
Floating gently, without a care.
Some are wispy, some are bold,
Stories of the skies they hold.

When the sun begins to set,
Colors blend, a perfect duet.
Golden hues and shades of gray,
Clouds transform at the end of day.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that dance and softly gleam.
In their beauty, we find peace,
A moment's joy that will not cease.
