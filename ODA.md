# Open Digital Architecture (ODA)

The Open Digital Architecture (ODA) is an industry-agreed blueprint, language, and set of key design principles. It provides a pragmatic pathway for transitioning from monolithic legacy software solutions to nimble, cloud-based capabilities orchestrated using AI. ODA serves as a reference architecture mapping TM Forum's Open APIs and assets against technical and business platform functions. 

## Key Features
- **Component-based Architecture**: ODA offers a component-based architecture where business functions are exposed as Open APIs. Component functionality is typically implemented as services and microservices, enabling independent management on scalable infrastructure using Agile development practices.
- **Simplification of OSS/BSS**: ODA replaces traditional OSS/BSS with simpler IT solutions, aiming to "kill the RFP" and promote experimentation through proofs of concept.
- **Market for Components**: The goal is to create a market for Lego-like OSS/BSS components that CSPs can integrate autonomously, leading to faster service innovation.
- **Evolutionary Path**: ODA offers an evolutionary path to a plug-and-play architecture.

## ODA Canvas
The ODA Canvas is a key component, serving as runtime support for ODA Component implementation, simplifying setup and operation, standardizing communication, and easing scaling. It improves maintenance without service disruption and enhances security, facilitating CI/CD and connecting components to a management and orchestration namespace for portability and isolation.

## Business Targets
ODA has two primary business targets: Digital Service Provider (focused on Digital Efficiency) and Digital Service Enabler (focused on Digital Enablement).
