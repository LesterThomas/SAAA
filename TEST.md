# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispers of the wind, a gentle spree.

Some are like cotton, soft and sweet,
Others like shadows, a cool retreat.
They dance and play, a whimsical show,
Painting the heavens, a beautiful glow.

When the sun sets, they blush and gleam,
A canvas of colors, a painter's dream.
Oh, how they change, in forms they mold,
Stories of the sky, forever told.
