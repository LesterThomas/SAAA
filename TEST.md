# Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift in the sky,\nWhispering secrets as they float by.\nA canvas of dreams, painted in blue,\nSoft shadows dance, as the sun breaks through.

They gather in storms, a thunderous roar,\nPouring down blessings, a life-giving pour.\nIn twilight's embrace, they blush and they glow,\nA fleeting reminder of beauty below.

Oh, clouds of the heavens, so gentle, so grand,\nYou weave through the skies, like a soft, silken strand.\nIn your ever-changing forms, we find peace and delight,\nA poem in motion, a breathtaking sight.
