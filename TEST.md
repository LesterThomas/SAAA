# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds begin to glide.
Whispers soft, they dance and play,
Painting dreams in shades of gray.

Cotton castles, floating high,
Drifting slowly, oh so shy.
Sunlight kisses, silver beams,
Molding shapes from our wild dreams.

Stormy shadows, thunder's roar,
Clouds unite, a mighty score.
Rain falls gently, nature's tears,
Washing away our doubts and fears.

As the sun begins to set,
Clouds ignite, a fiery net.
Colors blend, a canvas bright,
A masterpiece of day and night.

So look above, and you will see,
The beauty of clouds, wild and free.
In their presence, let us find,
A little peace for heart and mind.
