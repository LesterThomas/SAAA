# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering tales of the sea.

Some are shadows, some are light,
Painting dreams in day and night.
A canvas vast, a sight to see,
Nature's art, a mystery.

When the sun begins to set,
Colors blend, a perfect duet.
Golden hues and shades of gray,
Clouds dance in the twilight's play.

Oh, how they change, how they sway,
In the breeze, they drift away.
A fleeting moment, a gentle sigh,
Clouds above, in the endless sky.
