# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy shapes, like cotton candy,
Floating high, oh so dandy.
They gather round, in shades of gray,
Bringing rain, then fading away.

In the sunset glow, they blush and gleam,
A fleeting moment, like a dream.
Oh clouds above, so vast and grand,
You paint the sky, with a gentle hand.
