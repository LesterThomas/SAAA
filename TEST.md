# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky, so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds begin to glide.
Whispers soft, they dance and play,
Painting dreams in shades of gray.

Cotton castles, floating high,
Kissing gently with the sky.
Sunlight beams through gaps so bright,
Creating rainbows, pure delight.

Stormy clouds, they rumble low,
Bringing life with rain's soft flow.
Nature's tears, a sweet embrace,
Nourishing the earth's warm face.

As the day turns into night,
Stars peek through, a wondrous sight.
Clouds drift on, a lullaby,
Cradling dreams as time goes by.
