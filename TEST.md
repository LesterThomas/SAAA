# A Poem About Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift so high,
In the vast blue canvas of the sky.
Whispers of dreams in the gentle breeze,
Clouds dance and twirl with effortless ease.

Some are like cotton, soft and light,
Others like shadows, a mystical sight.
They gather together, a family so grand,
Painting the heavens, a magical land.

When the sun sets low, they blush with gold,
Stories of wonder and beauty unfold.
In the rain's embrace, they weep and sigh,
A symphony of nature, as time drifts by.

So look up above, let your spirit soar,
In the world of clouds, there's always more.
A reminder of dreams, both near and far,
In the sky's embrace, we find who we are.

As the storms roll in, they gather in might,
A tapestry woven, a breathtaking sight.
They rumble and roar, a powerful show,
In their fleeting forms, the wild winds blow.

Through the seasons they change, a beautiful dance,
From wispy white strands to a thunderous glance.
In the twilight's glow, they shimmer and fade,
A canvas of colors, a masterpiece made.

So cherish the clouds, in their ever-shifting grace,
For in their soft presence, we find our place.
A reminder of life, in its ebb and flow,
In the heart of the sky, our dreams will grow.
