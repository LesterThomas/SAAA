# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Cotton candy dreams, floating high,
Kissing the sun, as they pass by.
In the twilight glow, they turn to gold,
Stories of wonder, silently told.

When the storm brews, they gather near,
A symphony of thunder, for all to hear.
Yet after the rain, they part with grace,
Leaving behind a freshened space.

Oh, clouds of the heavens, ever so grand,
A fleeting moment, like grains of sand.
In your embrace, we find our peace,
A reminder that beauty will never cease.
