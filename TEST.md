**Ode to the Clouds**  
In the azure dome, they roam,  
Whispers soft, like a gentle poem.  
Cotton dreams in the sky's embrace,  
Drifting slowly, a tranquil grace.  

Puffy shapes in the sunlight's gleam,  
Floating high, like a child's dream.  
They gather, dance, and play around,  
In their realm, joy is found.  

Storm clouds gather, dark and deep,  
Secrets held, they silently keep.  
With thunder's roar and lightning's flash,  
Nature's power in a brilliant clash.  

As the sun sets, they turn to gold,  
Stories of the day, silently told.  
In the night, they fade from sight,  
Leaving behind the stars so bright.
