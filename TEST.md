# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering secrets to the sea.

Some are like cotton, soft and light,
Others gather, dark as night.
They dance and play, a gentle show,
Painting the sky with a radiant glow.

When the sun sets, they blush and gleam,
A canvas of colors, a painter's dream.
In the rain, they weep and sigh,
Yet bring the rainbow to the sky.

Oh, clouds above, so vast and grand,
You weave the tales of this wondrous land.
Forever changing, never the same,
In the sky, you play your game.
