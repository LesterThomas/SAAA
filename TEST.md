# A Poem About Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift so high,
In the vast blue canvas of the sky.
Whispers of dreams in the gentle breeze,
Clouds dance and twirl with effortless ease.

Some are like cotton, soft and light,
Others like shadows, a mystical sight.
They gather together, a family so grand,
Painting the heavens, a magical land.

When the sun sets low, they blush with gold,
Stories of wonder and beauty unfold.
In the rain's embrace, they weep and sigh,
A symphony of nature, as time drifts by.

So look up above, let your spirit soar,
In the world of clouds, there's always more.
A reminder of dreams, both near and far,
In the sky's embrace, we find who we are.
