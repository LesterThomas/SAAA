# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky, so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering secrets to the sea.

Cotton castles, dreams afloat,
On the breeze, they gently gloat.
Shadows dance on fields below,
As the sun sets, they start to glow.

Stormy clouds, a thunder's roar,
Bring the rain, a mighty pour.
Yet in their heart, a silver line,
A promise of the sun to shine.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that float like a soft cream.
In their beauty, we find peace,
A moment's joy that will not cease.
