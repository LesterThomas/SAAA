# Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift in the sky,\nWhispering secrets as they float by.
A canvas of dreams, in shades of gray,
They dance with the sun, then fade away.

In storms they gather, a thunderous roar,
Painting the heavens, a tempest's encore.
Yet in their embrace, a calm can be found,
As rain gently falls, kissing the ground.

Oh clouds, you wander, so free and so bold,
A story of nature, forever retold.
