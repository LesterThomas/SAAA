# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, so soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and they play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy and light, like cotton they roam,
Carrying stories from places unknown.
In the golden sun, they shimmer and glow,
A fleeting moment, a magical show.

When storms arise, they gather and swell,
A symphony of thunder, a tale to tell.
Yet after the rain, they part with grace,
Leaving behind a fresh, bright space.

Oh clouds, you wander, you drift and you glide,
In your gentle embrace, the world can confide.
A reminder of beauty, in every form,
You bring us the rain, you shelter the storm.
