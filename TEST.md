# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky, so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds begin to glide.
Whispers soft, they dance and play,
Painting dreams in shades of gray.

Cotton castles, floating high,
Chasing shadows in the sky.
Sunlight kisses, silver beams,
Clouds are woven into dreams.

Stormy tempests, thunder's roar,
Clouds unite, a mighty score.
Yet in calm, they drift and sway,
A gentle breeze, they float away.

Oh, clouds, you tell a tale so grand,
Of distant lands and shifting sand.
In your embrace, we find our peace,
A fleeting moment, a sweet release.
