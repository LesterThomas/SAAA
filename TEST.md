# Clouds

In the sky, they drift and sway,  
Soft and white, they dance and play.  
Whispers of dreams, they float so high,  
Painting shadows as they pass by.  

Cotton candy, a sweet delight,  
Beneath the sun, they shine so bright.  
A gentle breeze, they start to roam,  
In their embrace, we find our home.  

Stormy skies, they gather near,  
A symphony of thunder we hear.  
Yet after rain, they part the way,  
Revealing blue, a brand new day.  

So let us gaze, and let us dream,  
Of clouds that float like a silver stream.  
In their presence, we find our peace,  
A fleeting moment, a sweet release.
