# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy shapes, like cotton candy,
Floating above, so light and dandy.
They gather and swirl, a tempest's embrace,
In the heart of the storm, they find their place.

When the sun sets, they blush and glow,
Painting the heavens, a vibrant show.
In twilight's hush, they softly sigh,
A fleeting moment, as time drifts by.

Oh, clouds of wonder, ever so grand,
A testament to nature, a painter's hand.
In every form, a story unfolds,
In the sky's embrace, their beauty beholds.
