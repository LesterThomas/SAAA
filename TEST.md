### A Poem About Clouds

In the sky, so vast and wide,  
Fluffy clouds begin to glide.  
Whispers soft, they dance and play,  
Painting dreams in shades of gray.

Cotton castles, white and bright,  
Drifting slowly, a wondrous sight.  
They gather close, then drift apart,  
A gentle touch, a work of art.

Rainbows peek through, a splash of hue,  
As sunlight breaks, the world feels new.  
In their shadows, we find our peace,  
In the sky, our worries cease.

So let us gaze, and let us dream,  
Of clouds that float like a soft, sweet cream.  
For in their presence, we find a way,  
To chase our troubles far away.
