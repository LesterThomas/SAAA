# A New Poem About Clouds

In the sky so vast and wide,
Clouds like ships in the ocean glide.
Puffy white and shades of gray,
They dance and play throughout the day.

Some bring rain, a gentle shower,
Nourishing earth, a precious power.
Others drift in the golden light,
Painting sunsets, a breathtaking sight.

Whispers of dreams in their soft embrace,
A canvas of wonder, a tranquil space.
So let us gaze and let our minds roam,
In the world of clouds, we find our home.
