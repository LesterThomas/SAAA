# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispers of the wind, a gentle spree.

Some are like cotton, soft and sweet,
Others like shadows, a cool retreat.
They dance and play, a wondrous sight,
Painting the canvas of day and night.

When the sun sets, they blush and glow,
A palette of colors, a stunning show.
In the rain, they weep and sigh,
Yet bring the rainbow, a promise nigh.

Oh, clouds above, so vast and grand,
You weave the tales of this beautiful land.
In your embrace, dreams take flight,
A symphony of nature, pure delight.
