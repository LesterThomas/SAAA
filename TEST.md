# Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift in the sky,\nWhispers of dreams as they float by.\nA canvas of gray, a brush of the blue,\nIn the dance of the winds, they change their hue.

Softly they gather, a storm in their heart,\nPainting the heavens, a beautiful art.\nWith thunderous roars, they rumble and play,\nIn the light of the sun, they shimmer and sway.

Oh, clouds of the sky, so gentle and free,\nYou carry the rain, you cradle the sea.\nIn your fleeting forms, we find joy and peace,\nA moment of wonder that will never cease.
