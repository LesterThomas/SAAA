# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy shapes, like cotton candy,
Floating above, so light and dandy.
They gather and swirl, in a graceful ballet,
Casting shadows, as they sway.

In storms they roar, a thunderous sound,
Yet after the rain, peace is found.
A rainbow emerges, a bridge in the air,
A promise of hope, beyond despair.

So look to the heavens, let your spirit soar,
For clouds are the dreams that we all adore.
