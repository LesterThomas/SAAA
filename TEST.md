# Clouds

In the sky, they drift and sway,
Whispers of dreams in shades of gray.
Cotton castles, soft and bright,
Dancing gently in the light.

Puffy pillows, white and free,
Floating high, a sight to see.
They gather storms, they bring the rain,
A fleeting joy, a sweet refrain.

Sunset paints them pink and gold,
Stories of the skies unfold.
In their shadows, children play,
Imagining worlds where they can stay.

Oh, clouds, you wander, roam, and glide,
In your embrace, the hopes abide.
A canvas vast, a fleeting art,
In every heart, you leave a part.
