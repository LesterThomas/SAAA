# Clouds

In the sky so high and bright,  
Fluffy clouds take their flight.  
Whispers of white, drifting slow,  
Painting the blue with a gentle glow.  

Some are like cotton, soft and sweet,  
Others like shadows, a cool retreat.  
They dance and twirl, a graceful ballet,  
Changing their shapes throughout the day.  

When the sun sets, they catch the light,  
A canvas of colors, a breathtaking sight.  
Oh, how they wander, free and proud,  
A beautiful mystery, the ever-changing cloud.
