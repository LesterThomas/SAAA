# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering secrets to the sea.

Some are shadows, dark and gray,
Others dance in light of day.
A canvas painted, ever-changing,
Nature's art, forever ranging.

When the rain begins to fall,
Clouds unite, they heed the call.
A symphony of drops and sighs,
Kissing earth from cloudy skies.

So let us gaze and dream awhile,
At the beauty of each cloud's smile.
In their presence, we find peace,
As our worries start to cease.
