**Whispers of the Clouds**  
In the vast expanse of the azure sky,  
Fluffy clouds drift, like dreams passing by.  
Cotton candy puffs, so soft and white,  
They dance with the wind, a beautiful sight.  

Some are like castles, grand and tall,  
Others like wisps, so tiny and small.  
They gather together, a playful parade,  
Casting soft shadows, where sunlight has played.  

When storms brew fierce, they darken and swell,  
A thunderous symphony, nature's own bell.  
Yet after the rain, they part with a sigh,  
Revealing a rainbow, a promise up high.  

So let us look up, and dream with delight,  
For the clouds are the poets of day and of night.  
In their gentle embrace, we find peace and calm,  
A reminder of beauty, a soothing balm.
