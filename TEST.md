# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy shapes, like cotton candy,
Transforming forms, oh so dandy.
In the sunlight, they shimmer and glow,
A fleeting moment, a magical show.

When the storm brews, they gather and frown,
A curtain of gray, they settle down.
Yet after the rain, they part with grace,
Revealing the blue, a serene embrace.

So let us gaze, and let our minds roam,
For in the clouds, we find our home.
