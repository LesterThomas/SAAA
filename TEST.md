# Clouds

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,  
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.  
They dance and play in the azure blue,  
Casting shadows, a fleeting view.  

Puffy pillows, floating high,  
Kissing the sun as they pass by.  
In storms they gather, dark and bold,  
Tales of thunder and rain unfold.  

Yet in their grace, they bring us peace,  
A canvas of dreams that never cease.  
Oh, clouds above, so free and wild,  
Nature's art, forever beguiled.
