# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispers of the wind, a gentle spree.

Some are shadows, dark and gray,
Others dance in light of day.
A canvas painted, ever-changing,
Nature's art, forever ranging.

When the sun begins to set,
Clouds aglow, a sight to get.
Golden hues and pinkish tones,
A masterpiece that nature owns.

So look above, and you will find,
A world of wonder, unconfined.
In every shape, in every form,
Clouds bring beauty, calm, and storm.
