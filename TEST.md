**Whispers of the Clouds**  
In the vast expanse where the sky meets the blue,  
Fluffy whispers of clouds drift softly and true.  
They dance with the wind, in a graceful ballet,  
Painting the heavens in shades of the day.  

Cotton candy dreams float on high,  
Casting soft shadows as they wander by.  
A canvas of white, a tapestry grand,  
Molding and shifting at nature's command.  

They gather in clusters, a storm brewing near,  
With thunderous voices that echo our fear.  
Yet after the tempest, they part with a sigh,  
Revealing the sun, a warm lullaby.  

So let us look up, with wonder and awe,  
At the beauty above, the celestial law.  
For in every cloud, a story unfolds,  
Of dreams and of journeys, of mysteries told.
