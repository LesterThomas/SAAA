# Poem About Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift so high,
In the vast blue canvas of the sky.
Whispers of dreams in their gentle sway,
Casting shadows as they dance and play.

A soft embrace, they bring the rain,
Nourishing earth, easing the pain.
In twilight's glow, they blush and gleam,
A fleeting moment, a painter's dream.

Oh clouds, you wander, you roam so free,
A testament to nature's artistry.
In every shape, in every hue,
You tell a story, forever new.
