# Whispers of the Clouds

In the sky, so vast and wide,  
Clouds like ships in a gentle tide.  
Puffy dreams in shades of white,  
Drifting softly, a wondrous sight.  

Stormy grays and silver linings,  
Nature's art, with perfect timings.  
Whirling winds and thunder's call,  
In their dance, we find it all.  

So let us gaze and let us dream,  
In every cloud, a hidden theme.  
A world above, so free and grand,  
Whispers of the clouds, hand in hand.
