# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky, they drift and sway,
Soft and white, they dance and play.
Whispers of dreams in cottony forms,
They gather together, weathering storms.

Like artists painting the azure blue,
They change their shapes, a wondrous view.
From fluffy sheep to dragons bold,
In their embrace, stories unfold.

They cast shadows on fields below,
Bringing rain, a gentle flow.
A canvas of gray, a promise of light,
In the heart of the storm, they shine so bright.

So let us gaze at their fleeting grace,
In every corner of this vast space.
For clouds remind us, as they roam,
That in the sky, we find our home.
