# Clouds

Whispers of white in the azure sky,  
Drifting softly, they float and sigh.  
Cotton candy dreams, so light and free,  
Painting the heavens, a sight to see.

Mighty giants, they gather and roam,  
Casting shadows, they call the sky home.  
In the sun's embrace, they shimmer and glow,  
A dance of the winds, a gentle flow.

Stormy tempests, they rumble and roar,  
Bringing the rain, a life-giving pour.  
Yet in their softness, a beauty profound,  
In every shape, a wonder is found.

So let us gaze at the clouds above,  
Nature's canvas, a symbol of love.  
For in their presence, we find a reprieve,  
A moment of magic, if we just believe.
