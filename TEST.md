# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering tales of the sea.

Some are shadows, some are light,
Painting dreams in day and night.
A canvas vast, a gentle shroud,
Nature's art, the lovely cloud.

When the rain begins to fall,
Clouds unite, they heed the call.
Dancing droplets, fresh and clear,
Bringing life, they reappear.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that float like a soft cream.
In their presence, we find peace,
A moment's joy that will not cease.
