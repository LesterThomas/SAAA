**Ode to the Chickens**  
In the barn, they cluck and peck,  
Feathers ruffled, a lively trek.  
Omnivores bold, they scavenge and roam,  
In search of scraps, they make it their home.  

With beady eyes and a curious gaze,  
They scratch at the earth in a feathery haze.  
But beware the shadows that lurk in the night,  
For danger is near, and itâ€™s not out of sight.  

A hawk in the sky, a fox on the prowl,  
The world can be dark, and the night can howl.  
Yet in their clucking, a strength can be found,  
In the heart of the flock, they stand their ground.  

So let them roam, let them be free,  
In the dance of life, they find their glee.  
For even in peril, they rise and they shine,  
In the tale of the chickens, their spirit divine.
