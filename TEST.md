# Clouds

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,  
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.  
Puffy shapes in a sea of blue,  
Dancing lightly, as if they knew.

They gather together, a fluffy parade,  
Casting shadows, a cool serenade.  
In the sunlight, they shimmer and glow,  
A canvas of dreams, where wishes flow.

Sometimes they weep, in a gentle rain,  
Nourishing earth, a sweet refrain.  
Then they vanish, like a fleeting thought,  
Leaving behind the beauty they brought.

Oh, clouds of wonder, so free and bold,  
Stories of the sky, forever told.
