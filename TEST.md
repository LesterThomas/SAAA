# Clouds

In the sky so high and bright,  
Fluffy clouds take their flight.  
Whispers of white, a gentle breeze,  
Dancing softly, with such ease.  

Some are shadows, some are light,  
Painting the canvas, day and night.  
A cotton dream, a fleeting sight,  
Clouds above, a pure delight.  

They gather round, a stormy crew,  
Bringing rain, a freshened view.  
Yet in the sun, they drift away,  
Leaving blue skies for another day.  

Oh, clouds, you wander, you roam,  
In your embrace, we find our home.  
A poem of nature, soft and proud,  
Forever cherished, the lovely cloud.
