**Whispers of the Clouds**  
In the sky, so vast and wide,  
Fluffy wonders gently glide.  
Cotton castles, soft and bright,  
Dancing in the morning light.  

They gather round, a playful crew,  
Painting skies in shades of blue.  
Whispers of dreams, they softly share,  
Floating freely, without a care.  

Stormy tempests, fierce and bold,  
In their arms, the tales unfold.  
Raindrops fall, a sweet embrace,  
Nature's tears, a gentle grace.  

As twilight falls, they blush and glow,  
A canvas painted, a stunning show.  
In the night, they drift away,  
Leaving stars to light the way.
