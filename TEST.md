# Clouds

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering secrets to the sea.

Some are shadows, dark and deep,
Others dance, a gentle sweep.
A canvas painted, ever-changing,
In the breeze, their forms are ranging.

Oh, how they gather, thick and gray,
Bringing rain on a summer's day.
Yet when the sun breaks through the gloom,
They shimmer bright, dispelling doom.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that float like a soft cream.
In their presence, we find peace,
A moment's pause, a sweet release.
