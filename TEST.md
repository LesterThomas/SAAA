# Clouds Poem

In the sky so high and bright,
Fluffy clouds take their flight.
Drifting softly, white and free,
Whispering secrets to the sea.

Some are like cotton, soft and light,
Others bring storms, a fearsome sight.
They dance and play, a wondrous show,
Painting the sky with a gentle glow.

As the sun sets, they blush and gleam,
A canvas of colors, a painter's dream.
Oh, how they wander, how they roam,
In the vast blue sky, they find their home.
