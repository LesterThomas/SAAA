**Ode to the Chickens**  
In the barnyard bright, they cluck and play,  
Feathers ruffled in the light of day.  
Golden beaks and eyes so keen,  
In their world, they reign as queen.  

Pecking grains with joyful glee,  
Chickens roam so wild and free.  
With a flap and a hop, they strut about,  
In their clucking song, there's never a doubt.  

Under the sun, they bask and preen,  
In the grass, they find their green.  
With a cackle and a cheerful sound,  
In the heart of the farm, happiness is found.  

As the day ends, they settle down,  
In their cozy coop, they wear their crown.  
Dreaming of corn and fields so wide,  
In the night, with stars as their guide.
