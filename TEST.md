# Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift in the sky,
A canvas of dreams, where the eagles fly.
Whispers of rain, they softly bestow,
Dancing with sunlight, putting on a show.

In shades of gray, they gather and loom,
Foretelling the storms, bringing nature's boom.
Yet in their embrace, there's a calm so profound,
A reminder of peace, where solace is found.

Oh clouds, you wander, so free and so bold,
A story of beauty, in silver and gold.
In your gentle presence, the world feels alive,
A testament to wonder, where dreams can thrive.
