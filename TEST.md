**Ode to the Clouds**  
In the sky, they drift and sway,  
Shadows cast in a dance of gray.  
Whispers of storms in their silent shroud,  
Veils of mystery, the ominous clouds.  

They gather thick, a foreboding sight,  
Hiding the sun, stealing the light.  
With thunder's growl and lightning's flash,  
They unleash their fury in a torrential crash.  

Yet in their depths, a beauty lies,  
A tempest's rage, a painter's skies.  
In the chaos, a calm can be found,  
As nature's symphony plays all around.  

So let them roll, let them roam,  
In their embrace, we find our home.  
For even in darkness, there's a spark,  
In the heart of the clouds, a light in the dark.
