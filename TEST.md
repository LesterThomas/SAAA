# Clouds Poem

Whispers of the sky, soft and white,
Drifting gently, a beautiful sight.
They dance and play, in the azure sea,
A canvas of dreams, wild and free.

Puffy shapes, like cotton candy,
Floating high, oh so dandy.
In the sunlight, they shimmer and glow,
A fleeting moment, a magical show.

When the storm brews, they gather and frown,
A symphony of thunder, as they come down.
Yet after the rain, they part with grace,
Revealing the sun, a warm embrace.

So hereâ€™s to the clouds, in their endless roam,
A reminder of beauty, wherever we call home.
