# Dance of the Clouds

In the azure sky, they float and play,  
Whispers of dreams in a soft ballet.  
Cotton candy dreams, in the sunlight's embrace,  
Drifting and swirling, a delicate grace.  

Shadows they cast on the fields below,  
A canvas of stories, in sunlight's glow.  
From fluffy white to the stormy gray,  
They dance through the heavens, come what may.  

So let us watch as they change and shift,  
Nature's own magic, a wondrous gift.  
In every formation, a tale to unfold,  
The dance of the clouds, a sight to behold.
