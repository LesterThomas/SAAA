# Poem About Clouds

Fluffy and white, they drift so high,
In the vast blue canvas of the sky.
Whispers of dreams in their gentle sway,
Casting shadows as they dance and play.

Softly they gather, a billowy mass,
Changing their shapes as the moments pass.
A storm may brew, or a sunbeam peek,
In their embrace, the world feels meek.

Oh clouds, you wander, so free and bold,
Carrying stories, both new and old.
In your soft folds, the secrets you keep,
A lullaby sung as the world drifts to sleep.
