# Clouds in the Sky

Fluffy whispers in the blue,
Drifting softly, dreams anew.
Cotton castles, high and bright,
Chasing shadows, dancing light.

Storm clouds gather, dark and bold,
Tales of thunder, stories told.
Yet behind the tempest's frown,
Sunlight waits to wear the crown.

So let us watch the skies above,
In every cloud, a sign of love.
For in their forms, we find our way,
A canvas painted, day by day.
