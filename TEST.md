# A Poem About Clouds

In the sky so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds like dreams abide.
Drifting softly, white and bright,
Dancing gently in the light.

Whispers of the wind they share,
Casting shadows everywhere.
A canvas painted, soft and slow,
A tranquil scene, a gentle show.

When the sun begins to set,
Clouds aglow, a sight to get.
Colors blend, a fiery hue,
Nature's art, a stunning view.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that float like a soft stream.
In their presence, we find peace,
A moment's joy that will not cease.
