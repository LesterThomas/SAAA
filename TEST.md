# Poem About Clouds

In the sky, so vast and wide,
Fluffy clouds like dreams abide.
Whispers soft, they drift and sway,
Painting pictures, night and day.

Cotton castles, white and bright,
Dancing gently, pure delight.
Shadows cast on fields below,
A fleeting touch, a soft hello.

Stormy clouds, a darker hue,
Bring the rain, a cleansing dew.
Yet in their heart, a silver line,
A promise of the sun to shine.

So let us gaze and let us dream,
Of clouds that float, of skies that gleam.
In every shape, in every form,
They tell a tale, a gentle storm.
