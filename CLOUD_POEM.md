# Clouds in the Sky

Fluffy whispers in the blue,  
Drifting softly, a gentle hue.  
They dance and twirl, a silent song,  
In the vast expanse where they belong.

Puffs of white, like dreams set free,  
Casting shadows on land and sea.  
A canvas painted by the sun's warm light,  
Transforming day into the night.

Stormy grays and silver linings,  
Nature's art, forever shining.  
In every shape, a story told,  
Of fleeting moments, both young and old.

So gaze above, let your spirit soar,  
For in the clouds, there's always more.  
A world of wonder, a sight so grand,  
In the sky's embrace, we understand.
