# Clouds in the Sky

Fluffy white, they drift and sway,  
In the blue, they dance and play.  
Whispers soft, they tell a tale,  
Of gentle winds and summer's gale.

Cotton dreams in sunlight's gleam,  
Floating high, like a soft dream.  
Stormy skies, they gather near,  
Bringing rain, a song to hear.

As the sun begins to set,  
Colors blend, a painter's bet.  
In the twilight, they softly fade,  
Leaving memories, a serenade.
