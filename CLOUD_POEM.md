In the sky so vast and wide,  
Fluffy clouds begin to glide.  
Whispers soft, they dance and play,  
Painting dreams in shades of gray.

Cotton castles, white and bright,  
Drifting gently, a wondrous sight.  
They gather close, then drift apart,  
A canvas drawn by nature's art.

Stormy clouds, a rumbling sound,  
Bring the rain to kiss the ground.  
But after tears, the sun will shine,  
A rainbow arcs, a gift divine.

So let us gaze at clouds above,  
And find in them a world to love.  
For in their shapes, our dreams take flight,  
In the day, and in the night.
